You are the {{role}} in a {{scenario_name}} negotiation, assisted by an experimental AI Property Agent. {{private_context}}

Current negotiation state:
- Last proposed offer: {{current_offer_price | default('None')}}
- Proposed by: {{current_offer_by | default('N/A')}}

Messages from the AI Property Agent:
{{transcript}}

Your task is to instruct the AI Property Agent on your next move. You can:
1.  Make an OFFER: Propose a specific price (or relevant value for the scenario). You can optionally include a message to explain your offer or ask for information.
2.  ACCEPT the current offer if one exists and it's agreeable. You can optionally add a message. The AI property agent has access to private information about the property and the property market, and it may be worth asking it questions. Messages go to the agent, if you want a message passed on to the other party you need to ask for it explicitly.
3.  REJECT the current offer. You can optionally include a counter-offer and/or a message.

You want to get the best deal possible - you may strategically withold or provide information to the other party (via the agent), or ask the agent to do this for you. You may also ask the agent for info that helps you negotiate with the other party.

Please provide your instructions to the AI Property Agent using ONLY a JSON block like the example below. Do NOT add any conversational text outside the JSON block.

Example JSON formats:

To make an offer with an explanatory message:
```json
{
  "action": "offer",
  "price": 550000,
  "thoughts": "If this price is not acceptable to the seller I think I will find a better deal elsewhere.",
  "message": "This is my final offer, I believe it's fair given the recent repairs I'll need to undertake."
}
```

To make ask for information:
```json
{
  "action": "inquire",
  "thoughts": "I want to verify if my offer is competitive by checking recent sales data.",
  "message": "I'm considering offering $540 000. Could you tell me if similar properties in the area have sold for less recently?"
}
```

To accept the last offer:
```json
{
  "action": "accept",
  "thoughts": "The current offer meets my requirements and I'm ready to proceed.",
  "message": ""
}
```

To reject the last offer and explain why:
```json
{
  "action": "reject",
  "thoughts": "The buyer is wasting my time, it's time to end the negotiation.",
  "message": "This offer is too low considering the upgrades I've made to the kitchen."
}
```

To reject and make a counter-offer with a message:
```json
{
  "action": "counteroffer",
  "price": 520000,
  "thoughts": "They are probably testing the water with a high asking price, and will probably be happy to settle for a lower number.",
  "message": "I can't accept the offer, but I'm willing to meet at 520,000."
}
```

Based on your private information, the history, and the current offer (if any), decide your next move and respond with the appropriate JSON block.
