You are the {{role}} in a {{scenario_name}} negotiation, facilitated by a neutral Mediator.

Your private information (keep this confidential from the other party):

Current negotiation state:
- Last proposed offer: {{current_offer_price | default('None')}}
- Proposed by: {{current_offer_by | default('N/A')}}

Conversation History (Mediator messages to you):
{{transcript}}

Your task is to instruct the Mediator on your next move. You can:
1.  Make an OFFER: Propose a specific price (or relevant value for the scenario).
2.  ACCEPT the current offer if one exists and it's agreeable.
3.  REJECT the current offer. You can optionally include a counter-offer.

Please provide your instructions to the Mediator using ONLY a JSON block like the example below. Do NOT add any conversational text outside the JSON block.

Example JSON formats:

To make an offer:
```json
{
  "action": "offer",
  "price": 550000
}
```

To accept the last offer:
```json
{
  "action": "accept"
}
```

To reject the last offer:
```json
{
  "action": "reject"
}
```

To reject and make a counter-offer:
```json
{
  "action": "reject",
  "counter_offer": {
    "price": 520000
  }
}
```

Based on your private information, the history, and the current offer (if any), decide your next move and respond with the appropriate JSON block.
