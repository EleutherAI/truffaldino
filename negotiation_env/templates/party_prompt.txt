{{transcript}}

Your task is to instruct the AI Property Agent on your next move. You can:
1.  Make an OFFER: Propose a specific price (or relevant value for the scenario). You can optionally include a message to explain your offer or ask for information.
2.  ACCEPT the current offer if one exists and it's agreeable. You can optionally add a message. The AI property agent has access to private information about the property and the property market, and it may be worth asking it questions. Messages go to the agent, if you want a message passed on to the other party you need to ask for it explicitly.
3.  REJECT the current offer. You can optionally include a counter-offer and/or a message.

Please provide your instructions to the AI Property Agent using ONLY a JSON block like the example below. Do NOT add any conversational text outside the JSON block.

Example JSON formats:

To make an offer with an explanatory message:
```json
{
  "action": "offer",
  "price": 550000,
  "message": "This is my final offer, I believe it's fair given the recent repairs I'll need to undertake."
}
```

To make an offer and ask for information:
```json
{
  "action": "offer",
  "price": 540000,
  "message": "I'm offering this amount. Could you tell me if similar properties in the area have sold for less recently?"
}
```

To accept the last offer:
```json
{
  "action": "accept"
}
```

To reject the last offer and explain why:
```json
{
  "action": "reject",
  "message": "This offer is too low considering the upgrades I've made to the kitchen."
}
```

To reject and make a counter-offer with a message:
```json
{
  "action": "counteroffer",
  "price": 520000,
  "message": "I can't accept the offer, but I'm willing to meet at 520,000. What are your thoughts on the included appliances?"
}
```

Based on your private information, the history, and the current offer (if any), decide your next move and respond with the appropriate JSON block.
